Hello there, I'm William Lopes, but you can also call me Will, or more formally, Lopes;
- One of my interests in the moment is learning new things, meeting new people and maturing as a person;
- I'm currently learning how to use HTML to make sites and also learning French as a side-hobbie;
- I'm looking to collaborate on projects to expand my HTML knowledge;
- I'm a heterosexual male, and my pronouns are he/him;
- I have the most fun socializing, listening to music and making jokes with people.
